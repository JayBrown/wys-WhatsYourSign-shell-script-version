# wys â€“ WhatsYourSign (shell script version) <img src="https://github.com/JayBrown/wys-WhatsYourSign-shell-script-version/blob/master/img/jb-img.png" height="20px"/>

**Shell script version of Patrick Wardle's awesome [WhatsYourSign](https://github.com/objective-see/WhatsYourSign)**

Works with bundles (e.g. applications, extensions etc.), binaries/executables, disk images (DMG), packages (e.g. pkg), and archives (xar, xip).

In addition to the default WhatsYourSign functionality, **wys** also:

* performs a deep scan of a bundle, similar to **RB AppChecker Lite**, to find:
  * executable files that are unsigned, or
  * that are codesigned differently from the main executable
* prints the file size (B, MB, MiB)
* performs a comparison between a hash (checksum) stored in the clipboard and the hash calculated for the local file
* prints spctl assessments
* prints the codesigning timestamp
* prints the signing timestamp and creator from a package's toc

## Installation
**Note:** If you are using the macOS Finder, it's best to ignore **wys** and use Patrick's software, unless you need the additional functionality. The **wys** version is only meant as a quick hack for users who have disabled the Finder. Since the original **WhatsYourSign** is an `appex` (Finder extension), it will not work in other file managers.

### Example: Nimble Commander
* Navigate: NC > Preferences > Tools
* Tool title, e.g.: What's Your Sign?
* Application: `/path/to/wys`
* Parameters: `%P`
* Startup Mode: Detached
* Navigate: NC > Preferences > Hotkeys > All > Tools: What's Your Sign?
* Keyboard shortcut, e.g.: CMD-SHIFT-S
* Navigate: NC > Preferences > Hotkeys > Conflicts
* Change keyboard shortcut to resolve any potential conflicts

## Beta status
* still needs testing, especially for executable deep scan (any misses? too much?)
* research timestamp vs. signing time
* might need a one-line result at the top, similar to WhatsYourSign appex

## Screengrabs

#### Application signed with Developer ID

#### Malware application with revoked certificate (KeRanger)
*Notice the bogey RTF file, which is actually an executable part of the ransomware scheme.*

#### Malware application with fake codesigning certificate (OSX.CreativeUpdater)
*Compare the main executable code signature (fake) with the other signature (genuine by Mozilla). This malware is distributed as an app bundle within an app bundle.*

*Notice the bogey `script` file, which starts the download of the cryptominer malware.*

*Please note that the security assessment using `spctl` can still accept a codesigning certificate, while the more up-to-date verification with `security` already shows it as *revoked*.*

#### Auxiliary list with unsigned executable files
*Note that some developers erroneously set the executable bits on files that do not need it; *wys* scans will take longer in these cases.*
