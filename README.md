# wys â€“ WhatsYourSign (shell script version) <img src="https://github.com/JayBrown/wys-WhatsYourSign-shell-script-version/blob/master/img/jb-img.png" height="20px"/>

**Shell script version of Patrick Wardle's awesome [WhatsYourSign](https://github.com/objective-see/WhatsYourSign)**

Works with bundles (e.g. applications, extensions etc.), binaries/executables, disk images (DMG), packages (e.g. pkg), and archives (xar, xip).

In addition to the default WhatsYourSign functionality, **wys** also performs a deep scan of a bundle, similar to **RB AppChecker Lite**, to find executable files that are unsigned, or that are codesigned differently from the main executable.

## Installation
**Note:** If you are using the macOS Finder, it's best to ignore **wys** and use Patrick's software. The **wys** version is only meant as a quick hack for users who have disabled the Finder. Since the original **WhatsYourSign** is an `appex` (Finder extension), it will not work in other file managers.

### Example: Nimble Commander
* Navigate: NC > Preferences > Tools
* Tool title, e.g.: What's Your Sign?
* Application: `/path/to/wys`
* Parameters: `%P`
* Startup Mode: Detached
* Navigate: NC > Preferences > Hotkeys > All > Tools: What's Your Sign?
* Keyboard shortcut, e.g.: CMD-SHIFT-S
* Navigate: NC > Preferences > Hotkeys > Conflicts
* Change keyboard shortcut to resolve any potential conflicts

## Beta status
* still needs testing, especially for executable deep scan (any misses?)
* should have a one-line result at the top, similar to WhatsYourSign appex

#### Malware application with fake codesigning certificate (OSX.CreativeUpdater)
*Compare the main executable code signature (fake) with the other signature (genuine by Mozilla).*
*This malware is distributed as an app bundle within an app bundle.*
